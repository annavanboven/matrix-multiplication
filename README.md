# matrix-multiplication

The matrixmult program takes in a number of threads to spin and a size of a square matrix. It then generates
two random matrices and multiplies them together both with and without using threads, reporting the
speedup obtained by using threads.

This project is an assignment from Adam Smith's Operating Systems course (cs475) at University of Puget Sound.
